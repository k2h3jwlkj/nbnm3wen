Cranberry Brie Jalapeño Poppers

by LAURA REGE
NOV 20, 2020
Cranberry brie bites are by far one of our favorite appetizers for the holidays, but jalapeño poppers also have place in our hearts. The combination is really amazing. The spice of the jalapeño goes so well with the tart cranberries and the added bonus of wrapping the whole thing in prosciutto (or use bacon) is just extraordinary.

PREP TIME:
0 HOURS 15 MINS
TOTAL TIME:
0 HOURS 40 MINS
INGREDIENTS
(8-oz.) brie wheel, chopped into small pieces
1 1/2 c. shredded mozzarella
1 clove garlic, minced
Kosher salt 
Freshly ground black pepper 
1 (14-oz.) can whole cranberry sauce
12  jalapeños
prosciutto, halved lengthwise 
 
DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 400°. In a large bowl, combine brie, mozzarella, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Add ½ the can of cranberry sauce and fold throughout, don’t fully combine. 
Halve jalapeños lengthwise, then use a small spoon to remove seeds and veins. Fill with cheese mixture and wrap each with a halved slice of prosciutto.
Place on a baking sheet and bake until prosciutto is crispy and peppers are tender, about 25 minutes. Serve warm with remaining cranberry sauce.
